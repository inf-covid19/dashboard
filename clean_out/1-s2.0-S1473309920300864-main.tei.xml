<div><head>Introduction</head><p>Beginning in December, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China. 1 On Jan 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARSCoV2; previously known as 2019nCoV), was identified as the causative organism by Chinese facilities via deep sequencing analysis of patients' res piratory tract samples. </p><p>The clinical features of the initial 41 patients confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV2 included lower respiratory tract illness with fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea, 5 a manifestation similar to those of two other diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). </p><p>We aimed to analyse the evolution of chest CT imaging features in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, and to compare the imaging findings across the disease course, to facilitate early diagnosis of this newly emerging, life threatening infection.</p></div>
<div><head>Methods</head></div>
<div><head>Study design and participants</head><p>This was a retrospective study done at two centres in Wuhan. Patients with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital or Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, and who underwent serial chest CT scans, were retrospectively enrolled.</p><p>In the patients who presented to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, SARSCoV2 infection was confirmed by nextgeneration sequencing or realtime RTPCR, in according with a previously published protocol. </p><p>The diagnosis of the cases from Union Hospital was initially based on the criteria published by WHO on Jan 12, 2020, 12 and all cases were later confirmed by real time RTPCR analysis of throat swab specimens, using the same protocol as above when PCR kits were available.</p><p>Based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, we designated four groups of patients in our study: group 1 (subclinical cases, in which CT scans were done before onset of symptoms); group 2 (CT scans done &#8804;1 week after symptom onset); group 3 (CT scans done &gt;1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset); and group 4 (CT scans done &gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset). Three readers (XH, NJ, and YF) recorded the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and comorbidities of the patients at the time of imaging.</p><p>This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the relevant centres. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the ethics committee for this retrospective study.</p></div>
<div><head>CT image acquisition</head><p>All CT scans were obtained with patients in the supine position, using one of the following scanners: SOMATOM Perspective, SOMATOM Spirit, or SOMATOM Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Scans were done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle, and the following parameters were used: detector collimation widths 64 &#215; 0&#183;6 mm, 128 &#215; 0&#183;6 mm, 64 &#215; 0&#183;6 mm, and 64 &#215; 0&#183;6 mm; and tube voltage 120 kV. The tube current was regulated by an automatic exposure control system (CARE Dose 4D; Siemens Healthineers). Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1&#183;5 mm or 1 mm and an interval of 1&#183;5 mm or 1 mm, respectively. The</p></div>
<div><head>Research in context</head><p>Evidence before this study Before this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Jan, 24, 2020, for articles describing the radiological features of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms "novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" and "radiology "or "imaging" or "CT", with no time restrictions. We also searched CNKI and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese, with no time restrictions. We found only previously published research discussing the radiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and preliminary studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. We found no published work about the radiological characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></div>
<div><head>Added value of this study</head><p>We analysed chest CT images from 81 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and described the imaging findings across different follow-up periods of the disease, including subclinical and clinical stages up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest case series to date on the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide, and provides detailed information on the radiological, clinical, and laboratory features of these patients. Our findings provide insight in the evolution of the disease and its corresponding imaging changes, and suggest potential associations between imaging findings and patient outcomes, which requires further study.</p><p>Implications of all the available evidence SARS-CoV-2 has substantial capacity to infect humans, and is capable of human-to-human transmission. Infection can lead to severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the mortality rate is around 2%. Combining imaging assessments with clinical and laboratory findings could help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early.  CT imaging features recorded from our cohort are summarised in the appendix 2 (p 4).</p></div>
<div><head>Laboratory results</head></div>
<div><head>Follow-up chest CT</head><p>Followup chest CT scans were reviewed by two radiologists (HS and YF). The images were assessed and the evolution of lesions rated as either no significant change, resolution, or progression, compared with the previous chest CT from the same patient (appendix 2 p 4). Decisions were reached by consensus.</p></div>
<div><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Analyses were done with SAS software version 9.4. Distribution normality was assessed using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Normally distributed data were presented as mean (SD), nonnormally distributed data as median (IQR), and categorical variables as frequency (%). CIs of proportions were calculated using the ClopperPearson method. Differences between groups were analysed by Fisher's exact test (for categorical data) or oneway ANOVA (for continuous data).</p></div>

Although all lung segments can be involved, there was a slight predilection for the right lower lobe (225 (27%) of 849 affected segments among all patients). The mean number of segments involved among all groups was 10&#183;5 (SD 6&#183;4; range 1-18; appendix 2 pp 7-8), with significantly more segments involved in groups 2-4 (symptomatic patients) than group 1 (asymptomatic patients; p&lt;0&#183;0001). </p><p>By Feb 8, 2020, 62 (77%) patients had been discharged, with a mean interval between symptom onset and discharge of 23&#183;2 days (SD 6; range 12-41). 16 (20%) patients were still in hospital, and three (4%) patients had died (on days 12, 14, and 30, after hospital admission due to ARDS). Patient 1, who died on day 12 after admission, was a 60yearold man with chronic pulmonary disease (tuberculosis). The CT scan obtained from this patient on day 8 after symptom onset showed extensive ground glass opacities in both lungs, giving a white lung appearance ( </p><p>Followup CT images were obtained from 57 (70%) patients (36 from Wuhan Jinyintan hospital, and 21 from Union Hospital). 23 of these patients had two CT scans, 19 had three scans, and 15 had four scans available. Four patterns of evolution throughout the series of CT scans were observed among these 57 patients: initial progression to peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), seen in 26 (46%) patients (figure 6), of whom 24 (92%) patients were discharged from hospital (median stay 25 days [IQR 20-27]); radiographic deterioration (type 2), seen in 18 (32%) patients (figure 5), of whom two (11%) died (patients 2 and 3); radiographic improvement (type 3), seen in eight (14%) patients, of whom five (63%) were discharged from hospital (median stay 19 days [ ); and unchanged radiographic appearance (type 4), seen in five (9%) patients, all of whom were still in hospital at the cutoff date (Feb 8).</p></div>
<div><head>Discussion</head><p>The Coronaviridae family of viruses includes six prev iously known humaninfecting coronaviruses, which are enve loped, nonsegmented, positivesense RNA viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. </p></div>
<div><head>Figure 3: Distribution of various patterns of lung changes on CT scans at various timepoints from symptom onset</head><p>Stacked bars show the proportion of patients in whom the predominant CT pattern was ground-glass opacity, reticular, mixed, or consolidation. Patients were grouped by time from symptom onset: group 1 (scan before symptom onset; n=15), group 2 (scan &#8804;1 week after symptom onset; n=21), group 3 (scan &gt;1 week to 2 weeks after symptom onset; n=30), and group 4 (scan &gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset; n=15). lower than that of SARS or MERS coronavirus diseases; however, SARSCoV2 is highly infectious and could be a significant health threat. In our study, the predisposing conditions for COVID19 pneumonia tended to be old age and medical comor bidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases), similar to previous viral infections such as influenza H7N9. </p><p>Fever, cough, and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, consistent with the manifestation of lower respiratory tract infections. By contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common in these patients, indicating that the cells targeted by the virus might be located in the lower airway. </p><p>In our cohort, leukocytosis was detected in 26 (32%) patients and lymphocytosis in 54 (67%) patients. Concentrations of Creactive protein and serum amyloid A protein were elevated in most patients, as observed in previous betacoronavirus infections. </p><p>The mean number of involved lung segments in our cohort was 10&#183;5, with the right lower lobes most commonly affected. This finding is similar to those of a previous radiological study of patients with H7N9 influenza infection. </p><p>The extent of disease on CT scans showed a marked increase from the subclinical period through the first and second weeks after symptom onset, then decreased gradually in the third week. A previous study showed that the median time from onset of symptoms to mechanical ventilation was 10&#183;5 days (IQR 7&#183;0-14&#183;0) and to intensive care unit admission was 10&#183;5 days (8&#183;0-17&#183;0). </p><p>Most patients in our cohort showed bilateral lung involvement, with lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution. The predominant pattern was groundglass opacity, with illdefined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular inter lobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are nonspecific and bear some resemblance to those of SARSCoV </p><p>Serial CT imaging of patients could help to con tinuously monitor disease changes. Followup CT showed pro gression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes. On the other hand, progressive radiographic deterioration despite medical treatment seems to be associated with poor prognosis, with two deaths in our study occurring among the 18 patients with the type 2 pattern.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, at the time of data collection, nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection had not yet been introduced at Union Hospital, and 33 patients were therefore diagnosed clinically on the basis of WHO criteria. </p><p>In conclusion, COVID19 pneumonia tends to manifest on lung CT scans as bilateral, subpleural, groundglass opacities with air bronchograms, illdefined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. Abnormal lung CT findings can be present even in asymptomatic patients, and lesions can rapidly evolve into a diffuse groundglass opacity predominance or consolidation pattern within 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms, peaking at around 2 weeks after onset. Old age, male sex, under lying comorbidities and progressive radiographic deterio ration on followup CT might be risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID19 pneumonia.</p></div>
