<div><head>background</head><p>A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak.</p></div>
<div><head>methods</head><p>We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus-isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. results None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throatswab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population.</p></div>
<div><head>conclusions</head><p>A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Because of the death of Dr. Carlo Urbani, we propose that our first isolate be named the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus.

<div><head>general approach</head><p>The nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of patients with SARS and the urgency of finding a cause required that clinical specimens be tested rapidly for a broad range of viral, bacterial, chlamydial, and rickettsial agents (the CDC case definition of SARS is available as Supplementary Appendix 1 with the full text of this article at http://www.nejm.org). Laboratory testing focused foremost on known respiratory pathogens, especially those that might specifically target the lower respiratory tract through the progression of disease. A combination of traditional methods was applied, including virus isolation in suckling mice and cell culture, electron microscopy, histopathological examination, serologic analysis, and general and specialized bacterial culture techniques. The molecular techniques of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time PCR were used. Priority was given to testing for the following agents: yersinia, mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, Coxiella burnetii , spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae, influenzaviruses A and B, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae subfamily viruses (specifically, human respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus), Mastadenoviridae, Herpetoviridae, Picornaviridae, Old and New World hantaviruses, and Old World arenaviruses. biosafety Given the serious nature of SARS and the suggestion of person-to-person transmission, it was decided to handle all clinical specimens in a biosafety level 3 environment. All division into aliquots, pipetting, and culture attempts were performed in laminarflow safety cabinets in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Serum specimens that were tested serologically outside the laboratory were exposed to 60 Co gamma irradiation at 2&#172;10 6 rad while frozen on dry ice. Initial division into aliquots, handling, and culturing were undertaken in a biosafety level 3 laboratory area in which no culturing of known viruses is done. A similar environment was used when specimens from which nucleic acid was to be extracted were placed in a solution of chaotropic salts; after this step, the specimens were removed to other areas for completion of the extraction protocols.</p></div>
<div><head>isolation of virus</head><p>To identify viruses associated with SARS, we inoculated a variety of clinical specimens (blood, serum, material from oropharyngeal swabs or washings, material from nasopharyngeal swabs, and tissues of major organs collected at autopsy) onto a number of continuous cell lines, including Vero E6, NCI-H292, MDCK, LLC-MK2, and B95-8 cells, and into suckling ICR mice by the intracranial and intraperitoneal routes. All cultures were observed daily for cytopathic effect. Maintenance medium was replenished at day 7, and cultures were terminated 14 days after inoculation. Any cultures exhibiting identifiable cytopathic effect were subjected to several procedures to identify the cause of the effect. Suckling mice were observed daily for 14 days, and we further tested any sick or dead mice by preparing a brain suspension that was filtered and subcultured. Mice that remained well after 14 days were euthanized, and their test results were recorded as negative. Tissue-culture samples showing cytopathic effect were prepared for electron-microscopical examination. Negative-stain electron-microscopical specimens were prepared by drying culture supernatant, mixed 1:1 with 2.5 percent paraformaldehyde, onto Formvarcarbon-coated grids and staining with 2 percent methylamine tungstate. Thin-section electron-microscopical specimens were prepared by fixing a washed cell pellet with 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde and embedding it in epoxy resin. For RT-PCR assays, cell-culture supernatants were placed in lysis buffer. In addition, a master seed was prepared from the remaining culture supernatant and cells by freeze-thawing the culture flask, clarifying the thawed contents by centrifugation at 1000&#172; g, and dispensing the supernatant into aliquots stored in gas phase over liquid nitrogen. The master seed was subcultured into 850-cm 2 roller bottles of Vero E6 cells for the preparation of formalin-fixed positive control cells for immunohistochemical analysis, mixed with normal E6 cells, and gamma-irradiated for preparation of spot slides for indirect fluorescence antibody tests or extracted with detergent and gamma-irradiated for use as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen for antibody tests.</p></div>
<div><head>serologic analysis</head><p>Spot slides were prepared by applying 15 &#181;l of the suspension of gamma-irradiated mixed infected and noninfected cells onto 12-well Teflon-coated slides. Slides were allowed to air dry before being fixed in acetone. Slides were then stored at -70&#176;C until used for indirect fluorescence antibody tests. </p></div>
<div><head>pathological and immunohistochemical studies</head><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Vero E6 cells infected with the novel coronavirus and tissues obtained from patients with SARS were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and various immunohistochemical stains. Immunohistochemical assays were based on a method described previously for hantavirus. </p><p>Optimal dilutions of the primary antibodies were determined by titration experiments with cells infected with the new coronavirus and with noninfected cells or, when available, with concentrations recommended by the manufacturers. After sequential application of the appropriate biotinylated link antibody, avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex, and naphthol-fast red substrate, sections were counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with aqueous mounting medium. We used the following antibody and tissue controls: serum specimens from noninfected animals, various coronavirusinfected cell cultures and animal tissues, noninfected cell cultures, and normal human and animal tissues. Tissues from patients were also tested by immunohistochemical assays for various other viral and bacterial pulmonary pathogens. In addition, a bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen was available from one patient with SARS for thin-section electron-microscopical evaluation. open reading frame 1b to achieve broad reactivity with the genus coronavirus. These primers were used to amplify DNA from SARS isolates, and the amplicon sequences obtained were used to design SARS-specific primers Cor-p-F2 (+) 5'CTAACATGCTTAGGATAATGG3', Cor-p-F3 (+) 5'GCCTCTCTTGTTCTTGCTCGC3', and Cor-p-R1 (-) 5'CAGGTAAGCGTAAAACTCA-TC3', which were used in turn to test patient specimens. Primers used for specific amplification of human metapneumovirus have been described previously. </p><p>One primer for each set was 5'-end-labeled with fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) to facilitate GeneScan analysis. One-step amplification reactions were performed with the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) as previously described. </p></div>
<div><head>virus isolation</head><p>Two cell lines, Vero E6 cells and NCI-H292 cells, inoculated with oropharyngeal specimens from Patient 16 (a 46-year-old male physician with an epidemiologic link to a hospital with multiple patients with SARS) initially showed cytopathic effect </p><p>Examination of cytopathic-effect-positive Vero * Plus signs denote positive results, and minus signs negative results. The serologic and RT-PCR assays were not necessarily performed on samples obtained at the same time. &#8224; This was a late specimen, antibody positive at first sample. &#8225; Travel included China, Hong Kong (hotel), and Hanoi (the patient was the index patient in the French Hospital). &#167; Isolation was from the kidney only. &#182; Isolation was from the oropharyngeal specimen only. E6 cells by thin-section electron microscopy revealed characteristic coronavirus particles within the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles ( </p></div>
<div><head>serologic analysis</head><p>Spot slides with infected cells reacted with serum from patients with probable SARS in the convalescent phase. Screening of a panel of serum from patients with suspected SARS from Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, and the United States showed a high level of specific reaction with infected cells and conversion from negative to positive reactivity or diagnostic rises in the indirect fluorescence antibody test by a factor of four. Similarly, tests of these same serum samples with the ELISA antigen showed high specific signal in the convalescentphase samples and conversion from negative to positive antibody reactivity or diagnostic increases in titer </p><p>The isolation of a novel coronavirus from the respiratory secretions of a patient with SARS and the subsequent demonstration of this virus or a serologic response to this virus in others with SARS demonstrate an etiologic association between this virus and SARS. The discovery of this new virus occurred through a broad-based and multidisciplinary effort by clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigators and speaks to the power of a global collaborative effort to address the ever-present threat of emerging infectious diseases. </p><p>Possible reasons for the inability to demonstrate infection in some patients with suspected SARS include the lack of sufficient sensitivity of the assays to detect the pathogen and the immune response and the timing and type of specimens tested. For example, we have not yet received convalescent-phase serum specimens from many patients with suspected SARS and have not serologically ruled out infection in many such patients. In addition, we are just beginning to study the type and timing of clinical specimens most likely to support a diagnosis of infection with this new virus. We have made rapid progress in developing our diagnostic assays and are continuing to improve them for the detection of this virus or an immune response to it. In addition, the case definition of SARS is very broad and most likely includes other infectious diseases. We are also continuing to test for other infectious agents that might be associated with SARS, including those that might contribute to the severity of disease or increase the efficiency of viral transmission. Further clinical analysis of patients with SARS in whom there is laboratory confirmation of infection with the new coronavirus might help refine the case definition further.</p><p>The apparent lack of antibody in all serum specimens except those from patients with SARS suggests that this virus has not previously circulated in humans. Certainly, it has not circulated widely in humans, which is further evidence of an association between infection with this novel coronavirus and SARS. Presumably, this virus originated in animals and mutated or recombined in a fashion that permitted it to infect, cause disease, and pass from person to person. The available sequence data for this novel coronavirus suggest that it is distinct from   Pathological studies in patients who died with SARS show diffuse alveolar damage as the most notable feature, a finding consistent with the severe respiratory illness seen in some patients with SARS. The primary histopathological lesions seen in the lungs of four patients we studied are consistent with a nonspecific response to acute lung injury that can be caused by infectious agents, trauma, drugs, or toxic chemicals. However, the multinucleated syncytial cells without viral inclusions seen in the lungs of two patients, including one patient positive by PCR, serologic, and virus-isolation methods, are suggestive of a number of viral infections, including measles and parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Nipah virus infection. Syncytia have occasionally been observed in culture cells inoculated with other group I and II coronaviruses that infect humans, 26-28 but they are more often described in culture cells infected with animal coronaviruses. </p><p>We did not detect antigens of viruses associated with syncytial formation or SARS-associated coronavirus in these patient tissues, despite the severe pulmonary pathological processes. To detect this novel coronavirus antigen, we used an extensive panel of antibodies against coronaviruses representative of the three antigenic groups. The failure of these antiserum specimens to react with coronavirus antigens in the lung tissues of these patients could be attributed to clearance of viral antigens by the host immune response during the late stage of disease. The tissues of the four patients evaluated by immunohistochemical assays were obtained approximately two to three weeks into the course of the illness. For many viral infections, viral antigens and nucleic acids are cleared within two weeks of disease onset. </p><p>The investigation of the SARS outbreak serves as a positive template for laboratory and epidemiologic response to possible future infectious-disease pandemics. The rapid isolation and characterization of the novel coronavirus associated with SARS have allowed for the timely development of diagnostic tests that should aid our ability to understand the epidemiology of SARS and its prevention. Early recognition of this novel coronavirus has also made it possible to investigate antiviral compounds promptly and to begin developing vaccines. The speed with which this novel coronavirus was detected, characterized, and linked to SARS is a tribute to the power of the prompt communication and exchange of information among the World Health Organization collaborating laboratories about virus-isolation systems, PCR primers and virus sequences, and other diagnostic methods. This collaborative approach can be invaluable in our efforts to understand and control emerging public health threats.</p></div><note place="foot">n engl j med 348;20 www.nejm.org may</note>
