<div><p>Background Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.</p></div>
<div><head>Findings All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three)</head><p>, sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1&#183;0 &#215; 10&#8313; cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.</p><p>Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.</p></div>

<div><head>Introduction</head><p>The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease, and the ongoing outbreak has been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency. 1,2 COVID-19 pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December, 2019, followed by an outbreak across Hubei Province and other parts of the country. </p></div>
<div><head>,2 A study in</head><p>The Lancet by Huang and colleagues 2 reported the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical out comes, of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. However, Huang and colleagues' report mainly focused on non-pregnant adults. The clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women is unknown. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop distinct symptoms from non-pregnant adults, whether pregnant women who have confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to die of the infection or to undergo preterm labour, and whether COVID-19 could spread vertically and pose risks to the fetus and neonate. Answers to these questions are essential for formulating the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, to facilitate efforts, both in China and glo bally, to prevent and control COVID-19 pneumonia in children and pregnant women, </p></div>
<div><head>Methods</head></div>
<div><head>Study design and patients</head><p>We did a retrospective review of medical records from nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (4th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. </p><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number 2020004). Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.</p></div>
<div><head>Data collection</head><p>We reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for all nine pregnant women. All information was obtained and curated with a customised data collection form. Two study investigators (JG and XY) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.</p><p>Maternal throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR. </p></div>
<div><head>Research in context</head><p>Evidence before this study We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Feb 6, 2020, using the keywords "novel coronavirus", "2019 novel coronavirus", "2019-nCoV", "pneumonia", "coronavirus", "Wuhan", AND "novel" ,"pregnancy", "maternal infection", AND "fetal infection" for articles published in both Chinese and English. We found two articles: one titled </p></div>
<div><head>Added value of this study</head><p>We retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for nine pregnant women with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breastmilk, and neonatal throat swab samples from six of nine patients. All nine women were in the third trimester. Seven presented with fever without chill. Other symptoms included cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two). Fetal distress occurred in two cases. Five of the nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1&#183;0 &#215; 10&#8313; cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Nine livebirths were recorded. No severe neonatal asphyxia was observed. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-10 and 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six of the nine patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all results were negative.</p></div>
<div><head>Implications of all the available evidence</head><p>The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on data from this small group of patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.</p><p>the sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947). Partial S segment sequences (nt 21730-22458) were amplified with primers: 5&#8242;-CTCAGGACTTGTTCTTACCTT-3&#8242; and 5&#8242;-CAAGTGCACAGTCTAC-AGC-3&#8242;.</p></div>
<div><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 20.0. Continuous variables were directly expressed as a range. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%).</p></div>
<div><head>Role of the funding source</head><p>The funding agencies did not participate in study design, data collection, data analysis, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors were responsible for all aspects of the study to ensure that issues related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work were properly investigated and resolved. The final version was approved by all authors.</p></div>
<div><head>Results</head><p>The nine pregnant women were all in their third trimester, and all underwent caesarean section. All patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19. The age range of the patients was 26-40 years, and the range of gestational weeks at admission was 36 weeks to 39 weeks plus 4 days. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. One patient, Seven of the nine patients presented with a fever without chills, but none had a high fever (body temperature &gt;39&#176;C). Patients' body temperatures fluctuated within a range of 36&#183;5-38&#183;8&#176;C. The two patients with a normal body temperature before caesarean section both had postpartum fever (range 37&#183;8-39&#183;3&#176;C). Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: four patients had a cough, three had myalgia, two reported a sore throat, and two indicated malaise. Additionally, one patient showed obvious gastrointestinal symptoms. Another patient had shortness of breath and preeclampsia. However, none of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb 4, 2020. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress (in two of nine patients) and premature rupture of the membrane (in two of nine; table 1).</p><p>All patients were given oxygen support (nasal cannula) and empirical antibiotic treatment. Six patients were administered antiviral therapy </p><p>Data from laboratory tests showed that five of the nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia had lymphopenia (&lt;1&#183;0 &#215; 10&#8313; cells per L). Six patients had ele vated concentrations of C-reactive protein (&gt;10 mg/L). Three had increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), one of whom had ALT reaching 2093 U/L and AST reaching 1263 U/L. Additionally, seven patients had a normal white cell count, with none of the patients having a white cell count below the normal range (table 1).</p><p>All nine patients had a chest CT scan. Eight patients showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs 2 (figure).</p><p>Nine livebirths were recorded. No fetal death, neonatal death, or neonatal asphyxia was observed. Four patients had preterm labour, but all beyond 36 gestational weeks. Two of the four premature neonates at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days had a birthweight lower than 2500 g (table 2). Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and the pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia. Neonate 7 had a birthweight of 2460 g. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10 (table 2). Neonate 1 had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth (myoglobin 170&#183;8 ng/mL and creatine kinase-myocardial band 8&#183;5 ng/mL), but without any clinical symptoms.</p><p>The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples collected from six patients. Neither the Kit recommended by CDC nor our in-house nested RT-PCR assays detected SARS-CoV-2 in these samples.</p></div>
<div><head>Discussion</head><p>We report clinical data from nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infection, as previously reported. </p><p>According to our study, pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to non-pregnant adult patients, as recently reported. </p><p>The main focus of this study was to investigate the possibility of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection. We chose to test amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples at birth to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine fetal infection. Notably, all the samples tested in our study were collected in the operating room at the time of the caesarean section, thus guaranteeing that the samples were not contaminated and best represented fetal intrauterine conditions. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all of the above samples, suggesting that no intrauterine fetal infections occurred as a result of COVID-19 infection during a late stage of pregnancy. Our findings are in accordance with what was observed in SARS, which has a similar sequence to SARS-CoV-2. 14 Previous studies have already shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to mothers who developed SARS infection during pregnancy. </p><p>On Feb 6, 2020, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection 36 h after birth. </p><p>This study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective method. Several considerations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. First, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. The effect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified. Second, whether vaginal delivery increases the risk of mother-to-child intrapartum transmission, and whether uterine contraction could increase the possibility of the virus ascending, needs to be further investigated. Third, the risk of infection in pregnant women and the effects of the time or mode of delivery on pregnancy outcomes were not evaluated. Fourth, whether COVID-19 could damage the placenta, which represents an important link in vertical transmission, also needs to be further investigated. Future investigations of these issues and follow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary to ascertain the safety and health of mothers and babies exposed to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>In summary, the symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were diverse, with the main symptoms being fever and cough. We found no evidence for vertical transmission in late pregnancy. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, although our conclusions are limited by the small sample size, we believe that the findings reported here are important for understanding the clinical characteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.</p></div>
