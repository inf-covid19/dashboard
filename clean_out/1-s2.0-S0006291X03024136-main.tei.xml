			<abstract>
<div><p>We have cloned, expressed, and characterized the full-length and various soluble fragments of the SARS-CoV (Tor2 isolate) S glycoprotein. Cells expressing S fused with receptor-expressing cells at neutral pH suggesting that the recombinant glycoprotein is functional, its membrane fusogenic activity does not require other viral proteins, and that low pH is not required for triggering membrane fusion; fusion was not observed at low receptor concentrations. S and its soluble ectodomain, S e , were not cleaved to any significant degree. They ran at about 180-200 kDa in SDS gels suggesting post-translational modifications as predicted by previous computer analysis and observed for other coronaviruses. Fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17-537 and 272-537 but not 17-276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor, ACE2, recently identified by M. Farzan and coworkers [Nature 426 (2003) 450-454]. Together with data for inhibition of binding by antibodies developed against peptides from S, these findings suggest that the receptor-binding domain is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537. These results also confirm that ACE2 is a functional receptor for the SARS virus and may help in the elucidation of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV entry and in the development of vaccine immunogens and entry inhibitors.

<div><p>Viral envelope glycoproteins initiate entry of viruses into cells by binding to cell surface receptors followed by conformational changes leading to membrane fusion and delivery of the genome in the cytoplasm </p></div>
<div><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Antibodies and plasmids. New Zealand rabbits were immunized with 0.1 mg of various peptides selected by a computer program for their immunogenicity. Serum from the immunized rabbits was tested in ELISA and Western blot for reactivity. Sera from rabbits immunized with two peptides exhibited the highest and specific activity against the S glycoprotein and were selected for this study. The antibodies denoted D24 and P540 were elicited by the peptides DVQAPNYTQH TSSMRGC and PSSKRFQPFQQFGRDC, respectively. Another anti-SARS-CoV S glycoprotein polyclonal antibody IMG-542, which recognizes amino acid 288-303 of the S glycoprotein, was purchased from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). Plasmids encoding ACE2, pCDNA3-ACE2, and its soluble form, pCDNA3-ACE2-ecto, were kindly provided by M. Farzan from Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. VTF7.3 and VCB21R are kind gifts from C. Broder, USUHS, Bethesda, MD. Expression vectors pCDNA3 and pSecTag2 series were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).</p><p>Construction of full-length S glycoprotein cDNAs and cloning in expression vectors. Three pBR194c-based plasmids containing overlapping cDNAs that cover the full-length S glycoprotein coding sequence were purchased from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BC, Canada). The following primers were used for amplification and overlapping PCR cloning of the full-length S glycoprotein: #1, 5 0 AGTCGGATCC GGTAGGCTTATCATTAGAG 3 0 ; #2, 5 0 CCAT CAGGGGAGAA AGG CAC 3 0 ; #3, 5 0 GTGCCTTTCTCCCCTGATGG 3 0 ; #4, 5 0 GA AGAGCAGCGCCAGCACC 3 0 ; #5, 5 0 GGTGCT GGCGCTGCTC TTC 3 0 ; and #6, 5 0 ACTGTCTAGAGTTCGTTT ATGTGTAATG 3 0 . The amplified full-length S gene was cut with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in pCDNA3 plasmid to create pCDNA3-S. This plasmid was used to generate various soluble fragments of the S glycoprotein. The pair of primers #7, 5 0 AGTCGGAT CCGACCGGTGCACCACTTTTG 3 0 and #8, 5 0 AGTCGGGCCCCT GTTCAGCAGCAATACC 3 0 was used to amplify the S1 fragment containing residues 17-756. The fragment was cut with BamHI and ApaI and cloned into corresponding sites of expression vector pSecTag2B (Invitrogen). Primer #7 and primer #9 5 0 CTAGCTCGAGCAA-CAGCATCTGTG 3 0 were used to amplify fragment S276 containing residues 17-276. The fragment was cut with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pSecTag2B vector. Fragment S537 was generated by cutting S1 with BamHI and HincII and cloned into pSecTag2B cut with BamHI and EcoRV. To generate soluble S glycoprotein ectodomain, S e , site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create an ApaI site upstream to the transmembrane domain of the S glycoprotein gene in pCDNA3-S. Then this plasmid was digested with PstI and ApaI and the resulting fragment was used to replace the PstI-ApaI fragments from pSecTag2B-S1, creating the pSecTag2B-S e plasmid. PstI-ApaI fragment from pCDNA3-S was used to replace the PstI-ApaI fragment from pSecTag2B-S e to create pSecTag2B-S without tags. To create the fragment containing residues 272-537, the following pair of primers, primer #10 5 0 GATCGGATCCGGTACAATCACAG 3 0 and primer #11 5 0 GATCGGGCCCGACACACTGGTTC 3 0 , was used for PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and ApaI and ligated to pSecTag2B digested with the same restriction enzymes. All S fragments and full-length S constructed in pSecTag2B had their native leader sequence (aa 1-16) replaced with a mouse k chain leader sequence.</p><p>Protein expression. Vero E6 or 293 cells were transfected with various plasmids using the Polyfect transfection kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Four hours after transfection, cells were infected with VTF7.3 recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the gene for the T7 polymerase. The soluble fragments were obtained from the cell culture medium. The full-length S glycoprotein was detected only from cell lysate.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation and purification. Medium from cells transfected with various soluble S fragments was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The cleared medium was incubated with either Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or immunoprecipitating antibody plus glycoprotein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St. louis, MO) for 2 h at 4&#176;C. The beads were then mixed with an equal volume of SDS gel sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel analysis. For full-length S glycoprotein, cells were lysed first in PBS supplemented with 1% NP-40 and 0.5 mM PMSF for 1 h at 4&#176;C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a table-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 20 min. The cleared lysate was either immunoprecipitated first or used directly in Western blotting.</p><p>Western blotting and slot blots. Cells expressing the S glycoprotein were lysed first with a PBS-based NP40 lysis buffer as described above, and the debris were cleared by centrifugation. For soluble S fragments the medium was collected and cleared as described above. For slot blot, the cleared lysate or medium from supernatant was used directly to blot the nitrocellulose membrane following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the membrane was subjected to antibody detection as in conventional Western blotting. For Western blotting, the monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or the rabbit polyclonal antibodies obtained by immunization of rabbits with peptides were diluted in TBST buffer and incubated with the membrane for 2 h, washed and then incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP for 1 h, washed four times, each time for 15 min, and then developed using the ECL reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).</p><p>Cell-binding assay and ELISA. Medium containing soluble S fragments was collected and cleared by centrifugation. Vero E6 or other cells (5 &#194; 10 6 ) were incubated with 0.5 ml of cleared medium containing soluble S fragments and 2 lg of anti-c-Myc epitope antibody conjugated with HRP at 4&#176;C for 2 h. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were incubated with ABTS substrate from Roche (Indianapolis, IN) at RT for 10 min, the substrate was cleared by centrifugation, and OD405 was measured.</p><p>For ELISA, purified ACE2 (R&amp;D, Minneapolis, MN) was blocked to Maxisorp ELISA plate in pH 9.6 buffer at 100 ng per well. Medium (150 ll) containing various soluble S fragments and 0.6 lg of anti-c-Myc epitope antibody conjugated with HRP were incubated in each well at 37&#176;C for 2 h. Wells were washed and 60 ll of ABTS substrate was added to each well. OD405 was measured 20 min later.</p><p>Fluorescent dye redistribution cell fusion assay. HeLa or 293T cells, transfected with plasmids encoding the S glycoprotein, were loaded with Calcein AM (Molecular Probes), which is converted in cells to calcein green. The cells were incubated in medium containing 1 lg/ml Calcein AM for 1 h at 37&#176;C and 5% CO 2 , and then washed and resuspended in fresh medium. Plated target cells, Vero E6, were stained with CMAC (Molecular Probes) by incubation in 1 lg/ml CMAC in medium for 30 min at 37&#176;C and 5% CO 2 , then the cells were washed twice with medium and incubated for 20 min in fresh medium and washed again, and then covered with 0.5 ml medium in each well. The S-expressing cells, loaded with calcein, were added to the target cells and incubated for 1, 2, or 4 h at 37&#176;C and 5% CO 2 . Fusion was measured as the ratio between the cells that have double staining and the total number of target cells in contact with an S glycoproteinexpressing cell. Microphotographs were taken by using MethaMorph 4.0 software from Universal Imaging.</p><p>b-Galactosidase reporter gene-based cell-cell fusion assay. 293T cells (1.5 &#194; 10 6 ) were plated in T25 flasks one day before transfection. The next day, these cells were transfected with pCDNA3-S, pSectag2B-S, pCDNA3-ACE2, and pCDNA3-ACE2-Ecto, respectively, using the Polyfect transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Four hours after transfection, cells transfected with S constructs were infected with T7 polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus VTF7.3 and cells transfected with ACE-2 constructs were infected with b-gal encoding vaccinia virus (VCB21R). Two hours after infection, cells were incubated with fresh medium and transferred to 31&#176;C for overnight incubation. The next day S glycoprotein-expressing cells and ACE-2-expressing cells were mixed in 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37&#176;C. Three hours later, cells were lysed by adding NP-40 to a final concentration of 0.5%. Cell lysate (50 ll) was mixed with equal volume of CPRG substrate and OD595 was measured 1 h later.</p></div>

To explore the possibility that this was due to low sensitivity of these two assays, we also used another assay based on fluorescent dye redistribution that is able to detect fusion of single cells. We were not able to detect statistically significant differences between cells transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length S glycoprotein and various negative controls including plasmids encoding soluble S fragments at different pH (data not shown), suggesting that the higher levels of receptor expression achieved by expression of recombinant ACE2 could be important for cell-cell fusion. The underlying mechanisms remain to be  The background OD405 measured for the negative control was subtracted from the OD405s of each S fragment.

It is also possible that higher levels of S expression could lead to measurable cell fusion, even when the receptor concentrations are relatively low. Overall, these results suggest that recombinant S glycoprotein alone can mediate cell fusion, that fusion can occur at neutral pH, and that its efficiency is dependent on the concentration of the receptor molecules.</p></div>
<div><head>Identification of a receptor-binding domain</head><p>In an attempt to localize the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein prior to the identification of the SARS-CoV receptor, we developed an assay based on the binding of various soluble fragments to receptor expressing Vero E6 cells. Incubation of Vero E6 cells that are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and several cell lines that are not with soluble fragments resulted in binding only to Vero E6 cells by all fragments except the smallest one (S276) (Figs. 6A and B and data not shown). Binding was proportional to the expression levels of the fragments that were approximately inversely proportional to their sizes. These findings suggested that the RBD is localized between residues 272 and 537.</p><p>To further localize the RBD we used an antibody (IMG 542), which was elicited by a peptide containing residues 288-303.
